This dataset represents verb/noun paradigm categorization for three languages:

* German nouns (de_n.txt), German verbs (de_v.txt)
* Finnish nouns/adjectives (fi_na.txt), Finnish verbs (fi_v.txt)
* Spanish verbs (es_v.txt)

Each file is in a two-column format, one word/lemma per line with the paradigm information in the first column. For example, the Spanish verbs are represented as follows:

...
0       cantar
0       precisar
0       denigrar
0       aventajar
...
1       antagonizar
1       economizar
1       nacionalizar
1       fertilizar
...

Meaning that "cantar" belongs to conjugation class 0, "antagonizar" to class 1, etc.

The number of conjugation/declension classes are as follows:

de_n: 70
de_v: 140
fi_na: 258
fi_v: 282
es_v: 97

The raw inflection tables were originally scraped from Wiktionary by Durrett & DeNero (2013).  Lemmas were then grouped into paradigms by class grouping algorithm by Hulden (2014) and Ahlberg et al. (2014).
